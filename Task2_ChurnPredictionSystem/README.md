# 🔍 Task 2: Churn Prediction System

## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to build a **Churn Prediction System** that can identify customers who are likely to discontinue a service. This can help businesses take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

Using a supervised machine learning pipeline, the system processes customer behavior data and predicts whether a customer will churn.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior and trends
- Preprocess data for ML modeling
- Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance
- Deploy the model using a simple interface (optional)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data preprocessing  
  - `scikit-learn` – Machine learning modeling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization  
  - `joblib` – Model saving  
- (Optional) `Streamlit` or `Flask` for dashboard deployment
